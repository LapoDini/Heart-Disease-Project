# Heart Disease Classification Project

In this project, we want to predict if a patient has a heart condition from previous data.
We examined the data with an EDA and made visualizations to find the correlation between features. 
After that, we trained various models to predict heart conditions. 

## Data

The data are in csv format and are taken from Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci
